# QTop
## Version 0.1 - 22 July 2016

QTop is an open-source python module for simulation and visualization of 
topological quantum codes. QTop is object-oriented and easy to read,
facilitating the addition and assessment of new topological computing
architectures, as well as the development of novel decoders.

QTop allows for the simulation of topologies with arbitrary code depth,
qudit dimension, and error models. Both planar and toric geometries are 
supported. Currently, QTop features Kitaev quantum double models, as well as
color codes in all 3-regular planar tilings. In the future, I hope to add
3-dimensional color codes, gauge color codes, and more exotic topoligical
systems.
